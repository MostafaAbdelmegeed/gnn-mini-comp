# GNN Mini-Competition: Synthetic Node Classification

## Overview
Welcome to the GNN Mini-Competition! Your goal is to achieve the highest Macro F1 Score on a synthetic node classification task.

While the data is provided in CSV format (nodes with features), it implies a graph structure. You are encouraged to infer or generate a graph structure (e.g., k-NN graph) to apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for better performance, though standard ML methods (Random Forest, MLP) are provided as a baseline.

## Dataset
- `data/train.csv`: Training data with features `feat_0` to `feat_99` and `target` labels.
- `data/test.csv`: Test data with features only. You must predict the `target` for these IDs.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r starter_code/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Baselines**:
   The baseline script trains a Random Forest model and generates a submission file.
   ```bash
   cd starter_code
   python baseline.py
   ```
   This will create `submissions/sample_submission.csv`.

2b. **Run GNN Baseline** (Recommended):
   This script uses PyTorch Geometric to leverage the graph structure (`data/edges.csv`) and typically achieves higher scores.
   ```bash
   python baseline_gnn.py
   ```
   This will create `submissions/gnn_submission.csv`.

3. **Submit**:
   Currently, this is a local challenge. You can score your submission locally if you have the ground truth (which is generated by the setup script but conceptually "hidden").

## Scoring
To score your submission locally:
```bash
python scoring_script.py submissions/sample_submission.csv
```

## Rules
- You may use any library (PyTorch, TensorFlow, DGL, PyG, sklearn).
- You may generate your own graph structures from the node features.
